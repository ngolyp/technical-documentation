            <p>What is Object Oriented Programming?</p>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which
                programmers
                define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can
                be applied
                to the data structure. </p>

            <p>In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions.
                In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example,
                objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.</p>

            <p>There are four main concepts in object-oriented programming:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">
            <header>Abstraction</header>
            <p>Abstraction means using simple things to represent complexity.
                We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don’t need to know how it works in order to enjoy it.
                In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes, and variables represent more complex
                underlying
                code and data. This is important because it lets avoid repeating the same work multiple times.
            </p>

            <p>Abstraction as an OOP concept in Java works by letting programmers create useful, reusable tools.
                For example, a programmer can create several different types of objects.
                These can be variables, functions, or data structures. Programmers can also create different classes of
                objects. These are ways to define the objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, a class of variable might be an address. The class might specify that each address
                object shall have a name, street, city, and zip code. The objects, in this case, might be employee
                addresses, customer addresses, or supplier addresses.
            </p>
<!--             <p>For example:</p>
            <code>var address: {
                employee: string,
                customer: string,
                supplier: string
            };
            </code> -->
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
            <header>Encapsulation</header>
            <p>
                This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private,
                then providing access to them via public methods. It’s a protective
                barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. This way, we can re-use objects like
                code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide.
            </p>

            <p>These are different types of fields you can have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>public</li>
                <li>private</li>
                <li>protected</li>
                <li>package-private</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Encapsulation lets us re-use functionality without jeopardizing security. It’s a powerful OOP concept in
                Java because it helps us save a lot of time. For example, we may create a piece of code that calls
                specific data from a database. It may be useful to reuse that code with other databases or processes.
                Encapsulation lets us do that while keeping our original data private. It also lets us alter our
                original code without breaking it for others who have adopted it in the meantime.
            </p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <code>
                    //save as Student.java
                    public class Student {
                     private String name;
                     public String getName() {
                      return name;
                     }
                     public void setName(String name) {
                      this.name = name
                     }
                    }
                    //save as Test.java
                    class Test {
                     public static void main(String[] args) {
                      Student s = new Student();
                      s.setName(“vijay”);
                      System.out.println(s.getName());
                     }
                    }
                </code>

        </section>
        <hr>
        <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
            <header>Inheritance</header>
            <p>
                This is a special feature of Object Oriented Programming in Java. It lets programmers create new classes
                that share some of the attributes of existing classes. This lets us build on previous work without
                reinventing the wheel.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inheritance is another labor-saving Java OOP concept. It works by letting a new class adopt the
                properties of another. We call the inheriting class a subclass or a child class. The original class is
                often called the parent. We use the keyword extends to define a new class that inherits properties from
                an old class.
            </p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>In parent class</p>
            <code>
                public class Person {
                    ...
                }
            </code>
            <p>In child class</p>
            <code>
                public class Student extends Person {
                    ...
                }
            </code>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
            <header>Polymorphism</header>
            <p>
                This Java OOP concept lets programmers use the same word to mean different things in different contexts.
                One form of polymorphism in Java is method overloading. That’s when different meanings are implied by
                the code itself. The other form is method overriding. That’s when the different meanings are implied by
                the values of the supplied variables.
            </p>

            <p>
                Polymorphism in Java works by using a reference to a parent class to affect an object in the child
                class. We might create a class called “horse” by extending the “animal” class. That class might also
                implement the “professional racing” class. The “horse” class is “polymorphic,” since it inherits
                attributes of both the “animal” and “professional racing” class.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two more examples of polymorphism in Java are method overriding and method overloading.
            </p>

            <p>
                In <strong>method overriding</strong>, the child class can use the OOP polymorphism concept to override
                a method of its
                parent class. That allows a programmer to use one method in different ways depending on whether it’s
                invoked by an object of the parent class or an object of the child class.
            </p>

            <p>
                In <strong>method overloading</strong>, a single method may perform different functions depending on the
                context in which
                it’s called. That is, a single method name might work in different ways depending on what arguments are
                passed to it.
            </p>

            <p>For example in method overiding:</p>
            <p>In parent class</p>
            <code>
                public class Person {
                    public void talk() {
                        System.out.println(“Hello!”);
                    }
                }
            </code>
            <p>In child class</p>
            <code>
                public class Student extends Person {
                    public void talk() {
                        System.out.println(“What's Up!”);
                    }
                }
            </code>

            <p>An example in method overloading:</p>
            <code>
                public class Person {
                    public void eat() {
                        System.out.println(“I am eating!”); 
                    }
                    public void eat(food) {
                        System.out.println(“I am eating ” + food + "!"); 
                    }
                }
            </code>
